# AI Agent Reproduction Prompt

Use the following prompt to reproduce this entire analysis project using an AI agent (such as Matrix Agent, Claude, ChatGPT, etc.).

---

## PROMPT START

```
I need you to perform a comprehensive Master's-level time series analysis on my Mi Band 7 fitness tracker data. The author for all documentation should be "Momeni Gilles".

## Data Files Provided

I have three CSV files exported from the Mi Fitness app:
1. `*_hlth_center_aggregated_fitness_data.csv` - Daily aggregated health metrics (steps, sleep, heart rate, stress, SpO2)
2. `*_hlth_center_fitness_data.csv` - Minute-level granular sensor data
3. `*_user_fitness_data_records.csv` - Weekly summary records

The CSV files have a 'value' column containing JSON strings that need to be parsed. Timestamps are in Unix format (seconds since epoch) and the timezone is UTC+8.

## Project Requirements

### 1. Project Structure
Create an organized project folder with:
- `data/raw/` - for original CSV files
- `data/processed/` - for cleaned datasets
- `code/python/` - numbered Python scripts (01_, 02_, 03_)
- `code/R/` - R visualization scripts and RMarkdown report
- `docs/` - data dictionary and methodology documentation
- `output/figures/` - generated plots
- `output/reports/` - final analysis reports

### 2. Data Preprocessing (Python)
Create a preprocessing script that:
- Loads all three CSV files
- Parses JSON from 'value' columns
- Converts Unix timestamps to datetime (UTC+8)
- Creates daily time series by aggregating/merging data
- Handles missing values with statistical justification (document % missing)
- Detects outliers using IQR method and applies winsorization
- Engineers temporal features: day_of_week, is_weekend, week_of_year
- Exports: daily_combined.csv, summary_statistics.csv, data_quality_report.json

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (Python)
Create an EDA script that:
- Computes descriptive statistics (mean, std, min, max, quartiles)
- Tests stationarity using:
  - Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test
  - KPSS test
- Generates ACF and PACF plots (up to 40 lags)
- Performs time series decomposition (STL and classical)
- Analyzes correlation between variables
- Exports all results and figures

### 4. Time Series Modeling (Python)
Create a modeling script that:
- Uses auto-ARIMA or grid search to find optimal (p,d,q) parameters
- Fits ARIMA model for non-seasonal patterns
- Fits SARIMA model if weekly seasonality detected (period=7)
- Performs diagnostic tests:
  - Ljung-Box test for residual autocorrelation
  - Normality test on residuals
  - Residual plots
- Validates with 80/20 train-test split
- Calculates forecast accuracy metrics (RMSE, MAE, MAPE)
- Generates forecast plots

### 5. Visualizations (R with ggplot2)
Create an R script that generates publication-quality plots:
- Raw time series with trend line
- Seasonal decomposition components
- ACF/PACF correlograms
- Model diagnostics (4-panel residual plot)
- Forecast with confidence intervals
- Use professional theme, proper labels, legends

### 6. Academic Report (R Markdown)
Create an RMarkdown file that compiles into a formal report with:
- Title, author (Momeni Gilles), date
- Abstract
- Introduction (context, objectives)
- Data Description (source, variables, time period)
- Methodology (preprocessing, statistical tests, modeling approach)
- Results (EDA findings, model parameters, diagnostics)
- Discussion (interpretation, limitations)
- Conclusion
- References
- Appendix with additional figures

### 7. Documentation
Create:
- README.md - Project overview, structure, quick start
- USAGE_GUIDE.md - Detailed step-by-step instructions
- docs/data_dictionary.md - Variable definitions and descriptions
- docs/methodology.md - Statistical methods explained
- requirements.txt - Python dependencies

### Technical Requirements
- Python: pandas, numpy, scipy, statsmodels, matplotlib, seaborn
- R: ggplot2, forecast, tseries, lubridate, dplyr, tidyr, patchwork
- All scripts should have clear section headers and comments
- Use numbered prefixes (01_, 02_) to indicate execution order
- Handle errors gracefully with informative messages
- Print progress updates during execution

### Statistical Standards
- Report p-values for all hypothesis tests
- Use significance level α = 0.05
- Include 95% confidence intervals where appropriate
- Document any transformations applied (log, differencing)
- Justify all methodological choices

Please structure everything, create all files, and then execute the preprocessing script to verify the pipeline works.
```

## Notes for AI Agent Users

1. **Attach your data files** when sending this prompt
2. The AI will create the project structure and all code files
3. After creation, ask the AI to run each script sequentially
4. Request modifications if your data has different column names
5. The analysis assumes at least 30+ days of data for reliable results

---

## Customization

Modify the prompt above to:
- Change the author name
- Add/remove specific analyses
- Change the modeling approach (e.g., add Prophet, LSTM)
- Request different visualization styles
- Include additional statistical tests
